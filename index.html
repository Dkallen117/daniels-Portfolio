            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="content">
              My name is Daniel Allen. I am a Game Designer with a Bachelor of
              Science Degree in Game Design from Full Sail University. For as
              long as I can remember, creativity has been a driving force behind
              nearly everything I do. From winning third place at the World
              Competition for Odyssey of the Mind in Boulder, Colorado (as a 5th
              grader), to successfully coordinating a band to create a 6-song EP
              and perform at venues across Northeast Georgia, my creative
              passion never ceases to display itself. This passion also
              transfers over to my love for video games and my desire to create
              them. From blocking out and designing intricate levels, to writing
              captivating stories, and then testing them all (QA testing), I've
              dabbled in most aspects of Game Design and will continue to
              broaden my horizon. My personal favorite video game is Halo, and
              once I laid my eyes upon that game (also as a 5th grader), I knew
              instantly that I would help to continue that series, or help
              create other games that allows the players to be absorbed into
              what they’re experiencing as they play, as if they’re a part of
              the universe I helped create.
